# Follow-Up Sequences Templates

## LinkedIn Follow-Up Sequence (5 Messages)

### Day 0 - Initial Connection Request
```
Hi {first_name},

I noticed you're {role} at {company} and saw your work in {specific_detail}. 

I help {industry} companies optimize their {pain_point} through {solution_brief}. 

Would love to connect and share some insights that might be valuable for {company}.

Best,
{your_name}
```

### Day 2 - First Follow-Up (After Connection Accepted)
```
Hi {first_name},

Thanks for connecting! I wanted to reach out because I've been following {company}'s growth, particularly {recent_achievement/news}.

We recently helped {similar_company} achieve {specific_result} in just {timeframe}. 

I have a few ideas that could help {company} with {specific_challenge}. 

Would you be open to a brief 15-minute call this week to discuss? I have some time on {day_option_1} or {day_option_2}.

Best regards,
{your_name}
```

### Day 5 - Second Follow-Up
```
Hi {first_name},

I know you're busy managing {specific_responsibility} at {company}, so I'll keep this brief.

I put together a quick analysis showing how companies like yours typically leave {specific_metric} on the table due to {specific_issue}. 

The fix is surprisingly straightforward - happy to share the 2-page summary if you're interested.

No obligation - just thought it might be helpful given {company}'s focus on {company_priority}.

Worth a quick look?

{your_name}
```

### Day 10 - Third Follow-Up
```
{first_name},

Quick question - are you currently satisfied with your {specific_area} performance?

I ask because {trigger_event/industry_trend} is causing many {industry} companies to reassess their approach.

We just wrapped up a project with {case_study_company} where we:
• {result_1}
• {result_2}
• {result_3}

If improving {key_metric} is a priority for Q{quarter}, I'd be happy to share exactly how we did it.

15 minutes next week?

{your_name}
```

### Day 14 - Final LinkedIn Follow-Up
```
Hi {first_name},

I'll stop reaching out after this, but wanted to leave you with one thought:

{competitor_company} just announced {competitive_development}. This typically means {implication_for_industry}.

If {company} wants to stay ahead of this trend, the window to act is narrowing.

If you'd like to discuss a quick-win strategy, I'm here. Otherwise, I wish you all the best with {upcoming_challenge/opportunity}.

Feel free to reach out if priorities change.

{your_name}
P.S. - I'm hosting a webinar on {date} about "{webinar_topic}" if you'd like to join - no pitch, just insights.

## Email Follow-Up Sequence (6 Messages)

### Day 0 - Initial Outreach Email
**Subject Lines (A/B Test):**
- Quick question about {company}'s {specific_initiative}
- {first_name}, saw your post about {specific_topic}
- 15 min to discuss {specific_benefit} for {company}?

```
Hi {first_name},

I noticed {company} is {specific_observation} - congratulations on {recent_achievement}.

However, I also noticed {potential_improvement_area}. This caught my attention because we just helped {similar_company} {specific_result} by addressing the exact same challenge.

{company} could potentially {specific_benefit} within {timeframe} using a similar approach.

Worth a brief conversation to explore if this makes sense for your team?

I have 15 minutes available on {day_option_1} at {time_1} or {day_option_2} at {time_2}. 

Best regards,
{your_name}
{your_title}
{company_name}

P.S. - I put together a 2-minute video showing exactly how {similar_company} achieved these results. Happy to share if you're interested.
```

### Day 2 - First Follow-Up Email
**Subject Line:** Re: Quick question about {company}'s {specific_initiative}

```
Hi {first_name},

I know my last email might have caught you at a busy time.

Just wanted to add - I noticed {company} is hiring for {position}, which usually indicates {growth_indicator}. 

This is exactly when our solution delivers the most value. We can help you {specific_benefit} without adding headcount.

Here's a 30-second video showing the impact: {video_link}

Worth a quick chat this week?

{your_name}

P.S. - {client_company} said this was the best investment they made last year. Happy to introduce you to {client_contact} if you'd like to hear their experience firsthand.
```

### Day 5 - Second Follow-Up Email
**Subject Line:** {first_name}, your thoughts on this {industry} trend?

```
{first_name},

I've been tracking an interesting trend in {industry}:

{compelling_statistic} of companies are now {trend_description}, yet only {small_percentage}% are seeing positive ROI.

The difference? The successful ones focus on {key_differentiator}.

I wrote a brief analysis on how {company} could leverage this trend to {specific_outcome}. 

Would you like me to send it over? No strings attached - just thought it might be valuable given your role in {specific_responsibility}.

Best,
{your_name}

P.S. - The analysis includes a calculator showing potential ROI for {company}. Most clients see {roi_range}% returns within {timeframe}.
```

### Day 10 - Third Follow-Up Email
**Subject Line:** Bad timing, or not interested?

```
Hi {first_name},

I've reached out a few times about helping {company} with {specific_challenge}, but haven't heard back.

I realize this could mean:
1. This isn't a priority right now
2. You're not the right person to speak with
3. My emails are getting lost in your inbox

Would you mind letting me know which it is?

If it's #2, could you point me to the right person on your team?

If it's #1 or #3, I'll stop reaching out and you can contact me when/if this becomes a priority.

Thanks for your time,
{your_name}

P.S. - We just released a free tool that helps {industry} companies calculate {specific_metric}. Even if we don't work together, it might be useful: {tool_link}
```

### Day 14 - Fourth Follow-Up Email
**Subject Line:** Last attempt - {specific_benefit} for {company}

```
{first_name},

I promise this is my last email about this.

I'm working with {number} other {industry} companies this quarter, and they're all focused on the same challenge: {common_challenge}.

The solution we've developed delivers:
✓ {benefit_1} (average: {specific_metric})
✓ {benefit_2} (without {common_concern})
✓ {benefit_3} (in under {timeframe})

If {company} is facing similar challenges, we should talk. If not, I'll stop reaching out.

Either way, here's a resource that might help: {valuable_resource_link}

All the best,
{your_name}

P.S. - {competitor_company} just started using this approach. Just thought you should know.
```

### Day 21 - Final Email Follow-Up
**Subject Line:** Should I stay or should I go?

```
Hi {first_name},

I've sent you a few emails about helping {company} with {specific_challenge}, but I haven't heard back.

I'm going to assume you're either:
- Not interested
- Too busy right now
- Already have a solution in place

Before I close your file, I wanted to share one final resource:

{case_study_link} - How {similar_company} achieved {impressive_result} in {timeframe}

If you ever want to explore how {company} could see similar results, you know where to find me.

Wishing you continued success,
{your_name}

P.S. - I'm connecting with {other_title} professionals in {industry} next month at {event/webinar}. If you'd like an invite (no pitch, just networking), let me know.
```
