# MRC Project Session Log

## 2025-01-30: GitHub Integration & Connection Fix

### Session Overview
- **Focus**: Fixing GitHub integration and documenting connection status
- **Duration**: ~1 hour
- **Outcome**: Successfully reset GitHub repository and documented all connections

### Major Accomplishments
1. **GitHub Repository Reset**
   - Created backup of corrupted repository
   - Built clean repository from scratch
   - Preserved all 22 project files
   - Fixed security issue (exposed PAT tokens)
   - Established clean git history

2. **Documentation Created**
   - `CONNECTION_STATUS.md` - Complete system connection audit
   - `FOCUS_AREAS/github_integration.md` - GitHub setup guide
   - `SESSION_SUMMARY_20250130.md` - Detailed session notes

3. **Critical Discoveries**
   - Payment workflow has 48-hour delay (needs immediate delivery)
   - LinkedIn volume misconfigured (85/week not 85/day)
   - 3 n8n workflow JSON files ready for import
   - GitHub push protection now active (good security)

### Technical Details
- **Old Path**: `/mnt/c/Users/dvids/MRC/MRC_Project_Vault` (corrupted)
- **New Path**: `/mnt/c/Users/dvids/MRC/MRC_Project_Vault_clean` (production)
- **Backup Path**: `/mnt/c/Users/dvids/MRC/MRC_Project_Vault_backup_[timestamp]`
- **GitHub**: Force pushed clean history to main branch

### Next Session Priorities
1. Switch all tools to use clean directory
2. Import and modify n8n workflows
3. Fix payment processing delay
4. Correct LinkedIn distribution volumes

### Lessons Learned
- Never commit credentials to git (even in documentation)
- GitHub push protection is valuable security feature
- Clean reset sometimes better than fixing corruption
- Document everything for future reference
