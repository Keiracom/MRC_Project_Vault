# Distribution Strategy Update - Single LinkedIn Account

## LinkedIn Constraints
- **Accounts**: 1 LinkedIn account only (not 5)
- **Daily Connections**: 17 per day (safe limit for single account)
- **Weekly Total**: 85 connections/week (17 × 5 days)
- **Strategy**: Pre-generate all 85 reports weekly for instant delivery

## Email Volume
- **Daily Emails**: 833 per day
- **Weekly Total**: 4,165 emails/week
- **Strategy**: Category reports → Click for personalized report → Generate on demand

## Updated Distribution Flow

### Weekly Prospect Preparation (Sunday)
1. Scrape/enrich 5,000 prospects total
   - 85 for LinkedIn (week's worth)
   - 4,165 for email (week's worth)
   - Store all in Supabase with intelligence data

### LinkedIn Process (1 account)
- Monday-Friday: 17 connections/day
- Pre-generate 85 reports on Sunday (entire week's worth)
- Each prospect gets unique report URL ready
- When connection accepted → Send report link immediately

### Email Process  
- Monday-Friday: 833 emails/day
- Use category reports for initial outreach
- Click triggers report generation (3-5 min)
- Deliver via automated follow-up email

## Key Difference from Original Plan
- **Original**: 5 LinkedIn accounts × 17 = 85/day
- **Actual**: 1 LinkedIn account × 17 = 85/week
- This significantly reduces LinkedIn volume but maintains email scale
