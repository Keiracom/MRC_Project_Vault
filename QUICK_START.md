## üéØ Session Guidance

### Starting a Session
1. Read this QUICK_START.md for current status
2. Navigate to relevant FOCUS_AREAS for specific context
3. Check MISTAKES_AND_FIXES for known issues in your area
4. Update "Today's Priority" with current focus

### During Work
- Use "Route and save: [information]" for all updates
- Create [[bidirectional-links]] between related concepts
- Document decisions as you make them
- **CRITICAL**: Claude automatically syncs to GitHub after each save using:
  1. `filesystem:edit_file` for local changes
  2. `github:create_or_update_file` for immediate GitHub backup
  3. This ensures no information loss and clean version history
