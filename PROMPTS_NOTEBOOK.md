# MRC Project Prompts Notebook

## üöÄ SESSION START PROMPTS

### Universal Project Load (Use Every Session)
```
Load my MRC project from C:\Users\dvids\MRC\MRC_Project_Vault using filesystem MCP.

Read QUICK_START.md for current project status.

Today I want to focus on: [CHOOSE ONE: n8n workflows / dashboard development / supabase database / business operations / integration work]

Based on my focus area, read the relevant file in FOCUS_AREAS/ and check MISTAKES_AND_FIXES/ for known issues in that area.

Confirm you understand the current project status and today's focus before we begin.
```

### n8n Workflow Focus Session
```
Load MRC project via filesystem MCP.
Read QUICK_START.md for status.

Today's n8n task: [SPECIFIC TASK - e.g., "Create report generation workflow" or "Fix payment processing issue"]

REMEMBER: 
- Never use Basic LLM Chain nodes (use HTTP Request for Claude API)
- Complete JSON workflows only (no manual UI work)
- Always enable "Continue on Fail" for external APIs

Ready to work on n8n following our established patterns?
```

### Dashboard Development Focus
```
Load MRC project via filesystem MCP.
Read QUICK_START.md for status.
Focus: Dashboard development
