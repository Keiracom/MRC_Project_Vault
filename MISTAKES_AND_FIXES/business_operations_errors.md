# Business Operations Errors & Solutions

## API Cost Calculation Errors

### Error: SEMrush API Cost Miscalculation by 4,000x
**Date**: 2025-06-26
**Context**: Calculating costs for free report distribution strategy
**Error**: Calculated $0.20 per API unit instead of $0.00005 per unit
**Solution**: 
- Verified actual pricing: $1 for 20,000 units = $0.00005/unit
- Recalculated monthly costs: ~$15.45 for 813 reports (not $78,000)
- Confirmed strategy viability with correct numbers
**Prevention**: 
- Always check vendor pricing documentation directly
- Verify unit costs with simple division ($1 ÷ 20,000)
- Question any cost that seems business-model breaking
**Status**: ✅ Resolved
**Impact**: Enabled entire free report distribution strategy

### Error: Initial Template Design with 8 Competitors
**Date**: 2025-06-26
**Context**: Designing MRC Startup Tier Template for report generation
**Error**: Template included 8 competitors, multiplying API costs unnecessarily
**Solution**: 
- Reduced to 3 competitors (top competitors most relevant)
- Maintained report value while reducing API calls by 62%
- Kept option for more competitors in paid tiers
**Prevention**: 
- Start with minimum viable data points
- Calculate cost impact before finalizing templates
- Test value delivery with smaller data sets first
**Status**: ✅ Resolved
**Impact**: Reduced API costs by 62% per report

## Volume Calculation Issues

### Error: Confusing LinkedIn Daily vs Weekly Volumes
**Date**: 2025-06-26
**Context**: Planning report pre-generation for LinkedIn outreach
**Error**: Architecture suggested 85/day but reality is 85/week (one account limit)
**Solution**: 
- Clarified: 1 account × 17/day × 5 days = 85/week
- Monthly volume: 365 reports (not 2,550)
- Adjusted pre-generation strategy accordingly
**Prevention**: 
- Verify platform limits before scaling calculations
- Document assumptions clearly in architecture
- Cross-check volumes with multiple sources
**Status**: ✅ Resolved
**Impact**: Realistic volume planning for LinkedIn strategy
